      <p class="text-center fw-lighter">
        We design and write academic content for use in schools and
        organizations around the world. We are more than the standard
        instructional & design company. We work to improve the quality of
        academic content and its digital delivery to enhance the learning
        experience and its outcomes for learners and the
        organizations/institutions they represent. We are looking for writers,
        thinkers, desingers and subject matter experts in most disciplines to
        help us create a better way to learn. Bring your brain to Edufic and
        share it with the world. You can help improve learning for millions of
        Learners, including yourself. With so much at stake in education, the
        Edufic admittance process has become rigorous. Only the best candidates
        are accepted. Our acceptance standards and rates are more aggressive
        than those of the best schools in the world because we are creating
        academic content for students at those schools and for employers and
        organizations who demand a very high level of skill and performance from
        their team members. Therefore we need the Edufic team to be the best
        communicators, have high-level comprehension and critical thinking
        skills, and be confident in their subject knowledge.
